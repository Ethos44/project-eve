The hope is to create a vital satistic record for every human being on the planet. A birth-certifiacte that can follow you anywhere in the world for personal identifcation and medical records. Using a social media based app. Milestones and achievments are recorded. An open forum is created to connect you with your community. And a cryptocurrency fund that rewards individuals and organizations that advance and maintain ethical codes and standards. And open-dialog and crowd-funding platform during natural disaters and political/civil unrest unrest
